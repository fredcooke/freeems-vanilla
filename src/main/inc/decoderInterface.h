what is common between different setups? Add others here as required/desired/discussed.

		M-N setup - to sync we need gap that has just passed, and gap before, cases are: two gaps approx equal = who knows where. current gap = N * bigger means tooth after gap, current gap = N times smaller = second tooth after gap. Two opportunities to sync. by definition we always have these two gap measurements once synced. from these two gap measurements we can obtain a rough first RPM, then later RPM can be got from opposing teeth.
		4and1 setup - sync is obtained via logic, to get a rough RPM we need only one gap measurement, to verify noise free operation we need two. When we sync we may or may not have a previous gap measurement. For one sync opportunity we could have 0, 1, 2 gaps, for another we could have 0 or 1 gaps, and for the rest we will not have a gap measurement till a subsequent  event.
		24and2 setup - sync is obtained simply by watching for second trigger, sync is maintained by checking that second trigger falls when it should again. When a second trigger arrives, we could have 0, 1, 2 - ~12 primary gaps measured
		Simple setup - sync is not required, fire on all valid pulses. check for noise based on previous gaps, one event per ign event, correctly spaced timing required. Can be V twin, dizzy/points/outer of dsm/4and1 cas units, etc.

From this we need:

this stamp - have while running only. - so not required in header
previous stamp
stamp before previous stamp - only required on previous execution, at which time it is actually previous stamp, so not required.

this gap - have while running only. - so not required in header
previous gap - stored last time

flags to know if gap and stamp are valid - if gap is valid, stamp is not the oldest we effectively have.
previous gap valid - one flag
previous stamp valid - one flag

event counter - single unsigned value, 256 enough? probably can't cope with more than that anyway, except at low rpm, which is useless.

event angles - array of shorts, range required is 0 - 719.9999999999999 - can we provide sub degree accuracy with an unsigned short array? yes, what is best scale figure?

States:
* no sync (not of or of other three, no flag required, obviously)
* cylinder sync - one flag
* crank sync - one flag
* cam sync - one flag

from the above we can check one gap+angle with the next gap+angle and ensure smooth noise free operation is occurring.

/// @todo TODO sync loss/gain semantics - how paranoid? under what circumstances? should we make it configurable whether a decoder that is in a situation where it would find sync if not synced, resets sync, or loses sync. Likewise, at initial sync gain time, should it go "prelim sync found" and only verify sync on the second lap around, or start firing events straight off the bat. Starting will suck if paranoid, but if there is noise at high load/rpm and events get mis-scheduled before sync is lost, that is serious. This is philosophical, and the reality is that you must assume that your signal is clean to some level and verified clean under lower risk conditions.

 * around or similar.
 *
 * MAP Sampling:

 * Max number of samples = max number of cylinders, has to be handled by

 * pattern unless it is done on a rough multiple sample basis in generic code
 * that runs often and can approximate timing/position for sampling.

 * once per engine cycle, or something in between, but what is a reasonable
 * maximum, and is it workable to allow some cases and not others?

 *
 * Ignition pins will only need to be fired once per cycle (COP/CNP), twice per
 * cycle (Wasted Spark) or once per cylinder event (distributor) unless
 * multiple-spark startup is required, however this could be done with cascaded
 * dwell events, timer self-set:
 *
 * on dwell off spark on dwell off spark on dwell off and disable spark
 *
 * This example is for triple spark, 2 or more than 3 are also possible.
 *
 * When coils are wired one per cylinder for COP/CNP, during starting or loss
 * of cam sync two opposing coils will be fired at the same time in pseudo
 * wasted spark mode.
 *
 * Possible states of sync are as follows:
 *
 * Full cycle engine sync - COP/CNP/Sequential
 * Half cycle revolution sync - Wasted Spark/Semi Sequential
 * Cylinder sync - Distributor/Many pulses or un-timed batch pulses
 *
 * Wheels will have various patterns of rising/falling edges. Scheduling may be
 * done from either the rising or falling edge on some, or only on one edge of
 * others. VR sensors have only one reliable edge, the other varies with speed
 * and associated rise/fall times of the approximately sinusoidal wave form.
 * Simple patterns shall be required to be timed to the engine such that at low
 * engine speeds the timer delays available with high accuracy are sufficient
 * to properly time ignition events. At the least, there should be a wheel
 * event per cylinder event, and in close proximity to that cylinder event.
 * Allowing even more relaxed wheel patterns would mean compromising the
 * performance for other more common setups and/or increasing code complexity
 * by an unacceptable amount.
 *
 * OLD notes:
 *
 * arrays of output channels, iterate and check for wheel event number, if matched, fire:
 * doesn't allow for firing a pin more than once a cycle!! no use.
 * allows multi channel on a single wheel event (virtually useless) but is slow, one loop
 * and array per type of output channel.
 *
 * array of wheel events, do lookup for wheel event, then if output channel valid, schedule it.
 * single channel per tooth event (acceptable, wire in parallel if required), fast, memory hog,
 * need one array per type of channel, array length = max expected tooth count! do we need to
 * support every single tooth on a Nissan 360 style decoder or just cyl event count, what about
 * Porsche 130? next stop is 60, seems good. can we use bit-fields to save memory, 1 bit =
 * 2 possible pins, 2 bits = 4, etc, this will be slower, though. probably just an unsigned char[]
