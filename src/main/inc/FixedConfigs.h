 * @brief Struct typedefs for fixed configuration
 *
 * This file contains the struct data type definitions for fixed configuration items.
 *
 * Fixed, in this context means that it typically is not tuned in a live way
 * and therefore should not be cached in RAM while running. Usually these are
 * values that do not change such as cylinder volume, injector size, cylinder
 * count and other constants related to physical aspects of the engine setup.
 * When adding configuration values, please consider adding them here first.
 * If a value doesn't need to be live tunable definitely put it here instead.
