 * @brief For evenly spaced teeth on the camshaft with a single second input.
 *
 * This is suitable for engines such as the GM DIS Wasted Spark Ignition engines
 * with 2x TACH output which would equal 2 teeth on the crank and equal for
 * something with 4 on the cam. Sync is provided by the second input from the
 * CAM 1x sensor allowing a sequential and/or COP/CNP setup to be used.
